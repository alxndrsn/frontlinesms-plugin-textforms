			<h1>TextForms</h1>
			<h4>The TextForms plugin allows complex data gathering and simple type validation via SMS.</h4>

			<h2>What can I do with the TextForms?</h2>
			<h3>
				TextForms provides a powerful mechanism to gather data via SMS. 
				Data can be gathered as an individual question or as a series of questions called a TextForm.
				Each question has an associated keyword, which triggers a question handler if an incoming SMS message starts with that keyword.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				For example, the question with name <i>Total Beds</i>, keyword <i>beds</i>, type <i>Integer</i> and phrase <i>The total number of hospital beds?</i>
				will allow the plugin to receive the SMS message <i>"beds 46"</i>, storing the answer <i>46</i>.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				If the plugin simply receives the keyword <i>beds</i>, it is assumed the user is requesting information about that question, so will receive a message like 
				<i>Total Beds (Integer) The total number of hospital beds?</i>, which they can then simply reply with their answer (for example <i>ABC</i>).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				If the user submits an invalid answer (for example <i>ABC</i>) they will receive back a response message 
				<i>Invalid answer for Total Beds (expected Integer)</i> notifying them they entered an invalid response.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				You can also organize a series of questions into a TextForm, which will automatically send the user the next question after receiving a valid answer.

			<h2>Activating the TextForms plugin</h2>

				When FrontlineSMS is installed for the first time, the TextForms module is initially hidden from view. 
				To activate the TextForms module, go to the View menu, then select Tabs, and make sure "TextForms" is ticked. 
				A new TextForms tab should then appear with your other menus along the top of the screen. 
				To hide the TextForms module, go back into the same menu and remove the tick/check from the "TextForms" entry.
